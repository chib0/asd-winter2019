# All Your Thoughts Are Belong To Us
This is a project for the Advanced System Design Course of TAU / Winter '19-'20.
It's a not-too-big client-server app that teaches and showcases how to use different CI/CD tools as well as good software design patterns

I'll try to keep the code documented (as well as self documenting) while doing my best to explain design choices.

# Contents
- aytabtu - a python package implementing a clinet-server apo that communicates and stores messages(thoughts), a server then aggregates them, as well as implements a web-server that allows access to said messages(thoughts)

	- aytabtu/utils - a utitlity package that contains all non business logic stuff, or any stuff that could be reused in other systems.


# Usage
 ' TODO '

# Conclusion
I hope you had fun, hope you liked what you saw, reach out if you have any questions ( looking at you, whoever grades this, and also you, kind stranger that has stumbled across this somehow )
